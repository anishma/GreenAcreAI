# Testing Guide: Phase 5 & Phase 6

## Overview
This guide covers testing for:
- **Phase 5**: VAPI Integration & Post-Call Processing
- **Phase 6**: Dashboard & Analytics

## Phone Number Architecture

**Important**: Understand the difference between VAPI and Twilio phone numbers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        Phone Number Flow                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. Customer makes call:
   Customer's Personal Phone (+1-555-123-4567)
        ↓ CALLS
   VAPI Phone Number (+1-XXX-XXX-XXXX)
        ↓ stored in: tenants.vapi_phone_number_id
        ↓ used to identify which tenant owns this call

2. Voice conversation happens:
   [LangGraph AI conversation]
        ↓ extracts customer's phone number
        ↓ creates booking

3. System sends SMS notifications:
   Twilio Phone Number (+1-YYY-YYY-YYYY)
        ↓ FROM (stored in env: TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER)
        ↓ SENDS SMS TO:
        ├─→ Customer's Personal Phone (+1-555-123-4567) [booking confirmation]
        └─→ Owner's Personal Phone (tenants.phone_number) [lead/booking alert]
```

**Key Points**:
- **VAPI number** (`tenants.vapi_phone_number_id`) = Inbound calls only (voice) + tenant identification
- **Twilio number** (env: `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`) = Outbound SMS only (text)
- **Customer's personal number** = Extracted during call, receives booking confirmations
- **Owner's personal number** (`tenants.phone_number`) = Receives lead/booking alerts

---

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://..."

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="eyJ..."
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="eyJ..."  # Required for storage

# VAPI
VAPI_API_KEY="your-vapi-api-key"
VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-webhook-secret"  # Optional

# Twilio (for SMS)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="AC..."
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="..."
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="+1234567890"

# Google Calendar (already configured)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="..."
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="..."

# OpenAI (for LangGraph agent)
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Regrid (for property lookup)
REGRID_API_KEY="..."

# App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 2. Twilio Account Setup

**IMPORTANT**: VAPI phone numbers are for RECEIVING calls only. To SEND SMS notifications, you need a separate Twilio account:

1. **Sign up for Twilio**:
   - Go to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
   - Create a free trial account
   - Get $15 free credit

2. **Get a Twilio Phone Number**:
   - Go to Phone Numbers → Buy a number
   - Select a number with SMS capabilities
   - This will be your SMS "FROM" number

3. **Get Credentials**:
   - Go to Console → Account Info
   - Copy Account SID
   - Copy Auth Token

4. **Add to `.env.local`**:
   ```bash
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="ACxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your-auth-token"
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="+1234567890"  # Your Twilio number
   ```

**Architecture Clarification**:
- **VAPI Phone Number** (`tenants.vapi_phone_number_id`): Customers call this → handles voice conversation → identifies tenant
- **Owner's Personal Phone** (`tenants.phone_number`): Receives SMS alerts from Twilio
- **Twilio Phone Number** (env var): System uses this to SEND SMS → customers/owners receive SMS on their personal phones

### 3. Supabase Storage Bucket

Create the `call-recordings` bucket in Supabase:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create new bucket: `call-recordings`
3. Set as **Private** (we use signed URLs)
4. Follow setup guide in `Docs/SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md` for RLS policies

### 4. Database Migration

Ensure all migrations are applied:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Phase 5 Testing: VAPI Integration & Post-Call Processing

### Test 5.1: VAPI Webhook Endpoint

**Location**: `src/app/api/webhooks/vapi/route.ts`

#### Test 5.1.1: Call Started Event

**Simulate webhook**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/vapi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "call-start",
    "call": {
      "id": "test-call-001",
      "status": "in-progress",
      "phoneNumber": {
        "id": "pn-123",
        "number": "+14155551234"
      },
      "customer": {
        "number": "+14155559999"
      },
      "startedAt": "2026-01-08T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }'
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Call record created in `calls` table
- ✅ Webhook logged in `webhooks` table
- ✅ Response: `{"received": true}`

**Verify**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM calls WHERE vapi_call_id = 'test-call-001';
SELECT * FROM webhooks WHERE event_type = 'call-start' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

#### Test 5.1.2: Call Ended with Booking

**Simulate webhook**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/vapi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "end-of-call-report",
    "call": {
      "id": "test-call-001",
      "status": "ended",
      "endedReason": "assistant-ended-call",
      "startedAt": "2026-01-08T12:00:00Z",
      "endedAt": "2026-01-08T12:05:30Z",
      "transcript": "Customer: Hi, I need lawn mowing. Assistant: Great! Your appointment is scheduled for Monday at 10 AM. Customer: Perfect, thank you!",
      "recordingUrl": "https://example.com/recording.mp3",
      "cost": 0.45
    }
  }'
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Call updated with `outcome = booking_made`
- ✅ `booking_made = true`
- ✅ Recording uploaded to Supabase (if URL is valid)
- ✅ SMS sent to owner (if Twilio configured)

#### Test 5.1.3: Call Ended with Quote Only

**Change transcript** to:
```
"transcript": "Customer: How much for weekly mowing? Assistant: For your property, it would be $45 per week. Customer: Let me think about it."
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ `outcome = quote_given`
- ✅ `lead_captured = true`
- ✅ `quote_amount = 45.00`
- ✅ Lead record created (if address provided)

### Test 5.2: SMS Notifications

**Location**: `src/lib/twilio/sms.ts`

**IMPORTANT - SMS Architecture**:
- **VAPI Phone Number**: Used ONLY for receiving calls (voice conversation)
- **Twilio Phone Number**: Used for SENDING SMS notifications
- **Customer/Owner Personal Phones**: Receive SMS from Twilio number

**Flow**:
1. Customer calls VAPI number → voice conversation
2. System extracts customer's personal phone during call
3. After booking/quote, Twilio sends SMS FROM Twilio number TO customer's personal phone

#### Test 5.2.1: Customer Booking Confirmation

**Trigger**: Create a booking through the conversation graph

**Expected**:
- ✅ SMS sent FROM Twilio phone number TO customer's personal phone (extracted during call)
- ✅ Notification logged in `notifications` table
- ✅ `confirmation_sent = true` in booking record
- ✅ Customer receives SMS on their personal phone (NOT VAPI number)

**Test Setup**:
- Use your own phone number as the customer during testing
- Ensure Twilio credentials are configured in `.env.local`

**Verify SMS Content**:
```
Hi [Customer Name], your lawn mowing appointment with [Business Name] is confirmed for [Date/Time]. We'll see you then!
```

#### Test 5.2.2: Owner Lead Alert

**Trigger**: Call ends with quote given but no booking

**Expected**:
- ✅ SMS sent FROM Twilio number TO owner's personal phone (from `tenants.phone_number`)
- ✅ Notification logged with `template = new_lead_alert`

**Test Setup**:
- Set `tenants.phone_number` to YOUR phone number to receive owner alerts
- This is the business owner's personal phone, NOT the VAPI number

**Verify SMS Content**:
```
[Business Name] New lead: [Customer] at [Address]. Quote: $XX.XX. Check your dashboard for details.
```

#### Test 5.2.3: Owner Booking Alert

**Trigger**: Call ends with booking made

**Expected**:
- ✅ SMS sent FROM Twilio number TO owner's personal phone
- ✅ Notification logged with `template = new_booking_alert`

**Verify SMS Content**:
```
[Business Name] New booking: [Customer] at [Address] on [Date]. Quote: $XX.XX.
```

#### Test 5.2.4: Notification Preferences

**Test respecting preferences**:

1. Set `notification_preferences`:
```sql
UPDATE tenants
SET notification_preferences = '{"sms_new_lead": false, "sms_new_booking": true}'
WHERE id = 'your-tenant-id';
```

2. Create a lead

**Expected**:
- ✅ NO SMS sent for lead
- ✅ SMS sent for booking

### Test 5.3: Call Recording Storage

**Location**: `src/lib/supabase/storage.ts`

#### Test 5.3.1: Recording Upload

**Trigger**: Call webhook with valid `recordingUrl`

**Expected**:
- ✅ Recording downloaded from VAPI
- ✅ Uploaded to Supabase Storage at `{tenant_id}/{call_id}.mp3`
- ✅ Signed URL generated (valid for 1 year)
- ✅ Call record updated with Supabase URL

**Verify**:
```sql
SELECT recording_url FROM calls WHERE vapi_call_id = 'test-call-001';
-- Should show Supabase signed URL, not VAPI URL
```

#### Test 5.3.2: Get Recording URL

**Test programmatically**:
```typescript
import { getRecordingUrl } from '@/lib/supabase/storage'

const url = await getRecordingUrl('tenant-id', 'call-id')
console.log(url) // Should return signed URL
```

#### Test 5.3.3: Recording Exists Check

```typescript
import { recordingExists } from '@/lib/supabase/storage'

const exists = await recordingExists('tenant-id', 'call-id')
console.log(exists) // true or false
```

2. Log in as tenant B
3. Navigate to `/dashboard/calls/{tenant-a-call-id}`

**Expected**:
- ✅ Shows "Call Not Found"
- ✅ NO data leakage

### Test S.2: Webhook Signature Verification

**Future enhancement**: Implement VAPI signature verification

**Currently**:
- ⚠️ Webhook accepts all requests in development
- 📝 TODO: Add signature check in production

---

## Browser Compatibility

Test on:

- ✅ Responsive design on mobile

---

## Cleanup After Testing

```bash
# Remove test data
npm run prisma:studio

# Or SQL:
DELETE FROM calls WHERE vapi_call_id LIKE 'test-%';
DELETE FROM webhooks WHERE payload->>'call'->>'id' LIKE 'test-%';
DELETE FROM notifications WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

# Clear Supabase test recordings
# (Use Supabase Dashboard → Storage)
```

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **No pagination** on calls/leads/bookings pages (OK for MVP, add if > 100 items)
2. **No real-time updates** (requires Supabase Realtime subscriptions - Epic 6.2)
3. **No analytics charts** (line/pie charts - Epic 6.1.6)
4. **No lead status updates** from UI (can only view)
5. **No booking cancellation** from UI (Google Calendar integration needed)

---

## Success Criteria

**Phase 5 is successful if**:
- ✅ Webhooks process all call events correctly
- ✅ SMS notifications work (when Twilio configured)
- ✅ Recordings upload to Supabase
- ✅ Lead and booking data captured accurately

**Phase 6 is successful if**:
- ✅ Dashboard shows real-time metrics
- ✅ All CRUD pages (calls, leads, bookings) display data
- ✅ Call detail page shows transcript and plays audio
- ✅ Search and filters work on all pages
- ✅ UI is responsive and performant

---

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Fix any bugs discovered**
2. **Add pagination** if call volume is high
3. **Implement Epic 6.2**: Realtime subscriptions
4. **Implement Epic 6.1.6**: Analytics charts
5. **Add lead status updates** (inline editing)
6. **Add booking cancellation** (Google Calendar API)
7. **Deploy to staging** and test with real VAPI calls
